<H1>DocDawning's Ender 3 Pro Marlin 2.x Builds for BTT SKR Mini E3</H1>
This repository exists as a basic stanging ground for me to personally keep track of what I'm running on my Ender 3 Pro, which has a BigTreeTech SRK Mini E3 Version 1.2 that I picked up from <a href="https://spool3d.ca/bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v1-2-control-board-with-tmc-2209-uart/">Spool3d.ca</a>.

I am including a copy of the source I'm using from the Marlin project, you can go look at that project <a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin">here</a>.

<H2>INSTALLATION</H2>
NOTE: If you don't know how to install new firmware on your SKR Mini, then this probably isn't for you at all.

1. Load firmware on SKR
2. Run M502 to reset to factory defaults
3. Run M500 to save EEPROM
4. Power cycle SKR Mini

<H2>PROJECT GOALS</H2>
I just want to get my Ender 3 Pro working well for my use case. I like the 2209 drivers of the SRK Mini, they're so quiet, it's wonderful.
